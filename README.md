There are quite a few WebSocket Servers out there. The popular ones seem to be: [faye-websocket-ruby](https://github.com/faye/faye-websocket-ruby), [em-websockets](https://github.com/igrigorik/em-websocket). The client-only websocket gems are kinda hard to find, and are only raw websocket support. Rails has a thin layer on top of web sockets to help manage subscribing to channels and send/receive on channels.

This gem is a wrapper around [em-websocket-client](https://github.com/mwylde/em-websocket-client/), and supports the Rails Action Cable protocol.

## Usage

```ruby
require 'action_cable_client'

EventMachine.run do

  uri = "ws://localhost:3000/cable/"
  client = ActionCableClient.new(uri, 'RoomChannel')
  # the connected callback is required, as it triggers
  # the actual subscribing to the channel but it can just be
  # client.connected {}
  client.connected { puts 'successfully connected.' }

  # called whenever a message is received from the server
  client.received do | message |
    puts message
  end

  # adds to a queue that is purged upon receiving of
  # a ping from the server
  client.perform('speak', { message: 'hello from amc' })
end
```

This example is compatible with [this version of a small Rails app with Action Cable](https://github.com/NullVoxPopuli/mesh-relay/tree/2ed88928d91d82b88b7878fcb97e3bd81977cfe8)



The available hooks to tie in to are:
 - `disconnected {}`
 - `connected {}`
 - `subscribed {}`
 - `errored { |msg| }`
 - `received { |msg }`


Connecting on initialization is also configurable.

```ruby
client = ActionCableClient.new(uri, channel, false, connect_on_start: false)
client.connect!
```

this way if you also enable ping receiving via
```ruby
client.received(false) do |json|
  # now pings will be here as well, because skip_pings is set to false
end
```

you could track the time since you last received a ping, if you haven't received one in a while, it could be that your client is disconnected.

To reconnect,

```ruby
client.connect!
```

Action Cable Client Demo on YouTube (1:41)

[Here is a set of files in a gist](https://gist.github.com/NullVoxPopuli/edfcbbe91a7877e445cbde84c7f05b37) that demonstrate how different `action_cable_client`s can communicate with eachother.

## The Action Cable Protocol

There really isn't that much to this gem. :-)

1. Connect to the Action Cable URL
2. After the connection succeeds, send a subscribe message
  - The subscribe message JSON should look like this
    - `{"command":"subscribe","identifier":"{\"channel\":\"MeshRelayChannel\"}"}`
  - You should receive a message like this:
    - `{"identifier"=>"{\"channel\":\"MeshRelayChannel\"}", "type"=>"confirm_subscription"}`
3. Once subscribed, you can send messages.
  - Make sure that the `action` string matches the data-handling method name on your ActionCable server.
  - Your message JSON should look like this:
    - `{"command":"message","identifier":"{\"channel\":\"MeshRelayChannel\"}","data":"{\"to\":\"user1\",\"message\":\"hello from user2\",\"action\":\"chat\"}"}`
    - Received messages should look about the same

4. Notes:
  - Every message sent to the server has a `command` and `identifier` key.
  - Ping messages from the action cable server look like:
    - `{ "type" => "ping", "message" =>  1461845503 }`
  - The channel value must match the `name` of the channel class on the ActionCable server.
  - `identifier` and `data` are redundantly jsonified. So, for example (in ruby):
```ruby
payload = {
  command: 'command text',
  identifier: { channel: 'MeshRelayChannel' }.to_json,
  data: { to: 'user', message: 'hi', action: 'chat' }.to_json
}.to_json
```
